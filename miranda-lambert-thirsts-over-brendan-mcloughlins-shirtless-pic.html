While the twosome hit it off right away, the beginning of their romance was not without its drama. McLoughlin welcomed his son, Landon, with ex <strong>Kaihla Rettinger</strong><a href=#> just days after meeting</a> Lambert. The retired law enforcement officer was also&nbsp;engaged to <strong>Jackie Bruno</strong> when Rettinger became pregnant, Jackie’s mom, Carol Bruno, exclusively claimed to Us Weekly in February 2019.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“[Brendan] tried to deny it and then begged her to stay with him,” Carol told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;at the time. “[Jackie] was only going [abroad] for a few months to play [soccer], he was begging her to marry him before she left, even though he knew the girl was pregnant.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Miranda-Lambert-Thinks-Husband-Brendan-McLoughlin-Is-a-Full-Meal-in-Shirtless-Photo-Damn-Babe-450.jpg><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Despite the rocky start to their romance, Lambert and McLoughlin went on to tie the knot in 2019 — after just three months of dating — and the Grammy winner has since taken to her role as stepmom to Landon, now 4. The happy couple are<a href=#> “still trying” for their own baby</a> as well, a source exclusively told Us in October 2022.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“They would love to have a baby together in the near future,” the insider shared. “Miranda has always had that caring and nurturing side to her — especially after taking care of so many animals — so she’s ready for that next step.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>For now, the duo are enjoying their time together. Last month, they stepped out at the <a href=#>Academy of Country Music Awards</a>. The “Gunpowder & Lead” singer held tightly onto her beau <a href=#>while posing with him on the red carpet</a>.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Miranda and Brendan are doing amazing and even though it’s been a few years since they got married, they still feel like newlyweds,” an insider exclusively told Us in April. “Miranda loves having a husband who isn’t in the spotlight and doesn’t even care about things like that. He’s low-key and down-to-earth just like her and they <a href=#>couldn’t be a more perfect match</a>.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>For the Texas native, it’s “nice being able to have some privacy and not have every detail about their relationship scrutinized,” the source added. “They complement each other on every level and Miranda feels like she finally found her soulmate.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Prior to her relationship with McLoughlin, Lambert was married to <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a> from 2011 to 2015.

The pair confirmed <a href=#>they had called it quits</a> in July 2015.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“This is not the future we envisioned,” the “Not My Mama’s Broken Heart” songstress and the former&nbsp;Voice&nbsp;coach, 46,</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>said in joint a statement at the time. “And it is with heavy hearts that we move forward separately.
