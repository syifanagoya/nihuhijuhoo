He attended Walsh Jesuit High School in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. While a student there, he was a standout player on the football team. He then accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Ohio State University from 1993 to 1996. There, he played defensive end. As a senior, he was recognized as a first-team All-American and was named the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year in both 1995 and 1996, becoming the first of two players ever to win the award twice. He was named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000 and 2012; he was inducted into the Ohio State Athletics Hall of Fame.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Vrabel was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the third round of the 1997 NFL Draft.

He played in every game on defense and started in 12 games. He would also occasionally play as an eligible receiver when he would play in the position of tight end. This ability came in handy during Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 when quarterback <a href=# title="Tom Brady Net Worth">Tom Brady</a> threw a short pass to Vrabel, who was able to score a touchdown, making him the first defensive player to score a Super Bowl touchdown on offense since 1986.</p><p>The following year, in 2005, Vrabel again caught a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl, making him one of 17 players to catch two or more touchdown passes in Super Bowls. Throughout his professional playing career, Vrabel developed a reputation for being very reliable for touchdown conversions. Though he was a defensive player, he managed ten career receptions in 14 targets. No other player in NFL history has a better record of converting receptions to touchdowns. With the Patriots, he won three Super Bowls.</p><p>In 2009, the Patriots traded Vrabel to the Kansas City Chiefs. He played one season with the Chiefs before retiring from football as a player officially on July 10, 2011. He then accepted a position as a linebackers coach at Ohio State. From 2012 to 2013, he worked as a defensive line coach for Ohio State.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-359820 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mike-Vrabel.jpg alt width=900 height=521 sizes="(max-width: 1243px) 100vw, 1243px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-359820 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Silas Walker/Getty Images)</p><p>In 2014, Vrabel was hired by the Houston Texans as a linebackers coach.
