It took him five years to get here, but it’s been worth every minute. Thank you to our amazing surrogate for bringing him here safely surrounded by so much love.”</p><p>The Georgia native’s former costars showed their support in the comments, from <a href=#><strong>Lea Michele</strong> </a>to<a href=#><strong> Kevin McHale</strong></a>. “Love you, Ford!” the Scream Queens alum, 35, commented on the social media upload, while the actor, 33, wrote, “Love you all soooo much, congratulations.”</p><p>The reveal came seven months after Tobin told her “LadyGang” podcast listeners that she and Martin saw a fertility specialist and<a href=#> froze their embryos</a> after suffering a second miscarriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Glee-Becca-Tobin-Welcomes-1st-Baby-Via-Surrogate-With-Zach-Martin-After-Fertility-Struggles-02.jpg><p>“In my earlier 30s, I was <a href=#>having an ultrasound</a> and the doctor said, ‘Oh, my gosh, look at all those eggs,’ so I had a false sense of confidence in my ability to make a baby,” the singer said in the July 2020 episode. “I didn’t realize the weight that would be lifted the moment that I found out that I didn’t have to hurry up and keep trying and hopefully get something healthy.”</p><p>The songwriter<a href=#> wed her partner in December 2016 in Wyoming</a>, two years after their engagement. Tobin’s former costar<a href=#> <strong>Jane Lynch</strong></a>, who played Sue Sylvester on Glee, officiated the ceremony.

It was so incredibly exciting and super romantic. We loved being able to stick with that tradition.”</p><p>The American Musical and Dramatic Academy grad previously opened up about Martin’s proposal during a 2016 podcast episode, saying, “Every single person thought I was kidding.
