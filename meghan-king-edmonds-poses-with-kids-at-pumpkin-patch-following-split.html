The Real Housewives of Orange County alum, 35, was all smiles at Mari De Villa Senior Living with her 16-month-old twins, Hart and Hayes, and her 2-year-old daughter, Aspen, on her Instagram Story. Her eldest rocked a Cinderella gown, while her little brothers wore zippered onesies — a dragon for Hayes and a monster for Hart."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The former professional baseball player, 49, <a href=#>spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about their divorce and allegations that he cheated</a> on his wife with one of their four nannies, <strong>Carly Wilson</strong>.</p><p>“It’s dangerous, irresponsible and hurtful to all to allow a rumor to be spread to the world because of insecurities,” the athlete said.</p><p><a href=#>Wilson also denied the affair</a>, telling a commenter on Instagram that the accusations are “completely false.”</p><p><a href=#>Meghan confronted them</a> a week before the split, a source told Us.&nbsp;“The nanny is someone who has worked for them for years and is like family,” the insider said. “During the argument [about it], Meghan called the cops, but nothing came of it. Jim didn’t put his hands on her. The police chalked it up to a verbal dispute. No arrests were made.”</p><p>In June, Jim was caught sending inappropriate texts to a woman Us later identified as <a href=#><strong>Jennifer McFelia Villegas</strong></a>. Meghan addressed the messages<a href=#> in a blog post</a> at the time, writing, “I love him. How can I turn my feelings around so quickly? How can one person decide to utterly ruin me? It’s not fair. I sob so much my face stings from the salt from my tears. I am exhausted. My poor kids aren’t getting their devoted mother. And it’s only been 36 hours.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Jim denied having a “physical relationship”</a> with the woman, telling Us exclusviely, “I had a lapse in judgment.”</p><p>The estranged couple tied the knot in 2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZedrq95yqKloGWVmbqwusOsZKmno5rAbsPIrZ9mo5mZwG6t02anrqWgoLavec%2Baq5ygXZu8rbjOsKCnn12ova2102g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
