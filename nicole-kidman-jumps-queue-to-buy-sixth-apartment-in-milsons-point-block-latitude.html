Three more apartments followed, for $7m, $2.78m and last year they paid $1.35m for a one-bedder on level four, believed to be used as a private gym. In all they have spent $27.5m on units in Latitude.</p><p>The block started life as a commercial building in the 1970s but was repurposed in 2005 by Mirvac to accommodate 120 residential apartments. The block also has a swimming pool, spa, sauna, and gym for residents to use. Clark Park and Wendy Whiteley’s Secret Garden is next door.</p><p>There are no other units to buy in Latitude currently, but you can rent a one-bedroom unit on the fourth floor for $750 a week through Di Jones Lower North Shore.</p><p>Originally published as <a class=body-link href=#>Nicole Kidman jumps queue to buy sixth apartment in Milsons Point block Latitude</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyzscClZJ6rpJbBpnvNopqopJViuKqwzJqlZqKlor20edCunK6dXam8bq7UsmSsoaiptW6tz5qpraWVo8Futc1mpKKko6S7tHnPqKCnrF2XubCvymajmqyZqcKlsY6nnLCrXajBsL7YaGedapKWrnKDkGqdnm5mloWiscRxnW1tlGyzprKVcpib</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
