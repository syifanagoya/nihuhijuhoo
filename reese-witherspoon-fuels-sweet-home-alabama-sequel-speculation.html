(<strong>Candice Bergen</strong>, <strong>Mary Kay Place</strong>, <strong>Fred Ward</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Jean Smart</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ethan Embry</strong></a> rounded out the original cast.)</p><p>Fans speculated in the comments section whether the former costars were hinting at a continuation to the flick. “Sequel?” one person asked, while another wrote, “@joshlucas talked about <a href=#>being interested in a sequel</a>, now Reese posted this. Could it be??” A third Instagram user joked, “Did she say, ‘we need a sequel?’”</p><p>Witherspoon’s reflection on the movie comes two days after Lucas, 50, revealed why a second film may never happen. “Look, I would love to do the sequel. The issue is Reese’s got a book club,” he quipped during a Tuesday, July 6, appearance on SiriusXM’s Pop Culture Spotlight With Jessica Shaw. “And I’m saying that, like, laughingly, but Reese is, you know, I’ve heard like, ‘Oh, you <a href=#>can talk to her about stuff five years from now</a>.’ You know, she’s a mogul.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actor continued: “And back when I was doing Sweet Home Alabama, I, for some reason, remember telling the director or somebody speaking about her, but I said, ‘I bet this woman ends up running a movie studio one day.’ And she’s even beyond that at this point. … I mean, it’s extraordinary and not surprising either, at all.”</p><p>Witherspoon previously addressed the rumors in August 2016. “I <a href=#>love Sweet Home Alabama</a>!” she explained during a Facebook Live chat. “We are not making a sequel that I know of, but if Disney wants to call me, I would happily make a Sweet Home Alabama 2!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmenaOaeri106Gcq6ugpLyvecWunKWrXajEprHTZp%2BopZVirq2twZqkmmWjmr62sctmqqmdk6q5osDIqKVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
