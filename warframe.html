While you can purchase the frame by spending Platinum, there's a way to get her for free. Whether you're new to Warframe or just wondering what resources to farm, you're in the right place. Here's our guide explaining how to get Dagath in Warframe.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Craft Dagath in Warframe&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/K2s-DqduWwCwsmoqH4ahkl7XdNTQFRzhZgWjupyNI-M/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9XYXJmcmFtZS93aGlzcGVyc2ludGhld2FsbC9kYWdhdGhjb25jZXB0YXJ0LnBuZw><p>To get Dagath in Warframe, you first need to get hold of her blueprints. You can purchase Dagath's blueprints by visiting <strong>Dagath's Hallow Dojo Room</strong> and interacting with the Shrine of Dagath.&nbsp;</p><p>To purchase Dagath's blueprints, you will need a new resource called <strong>Vainthorn</strong>. These will only drop from a new Exterminate mission that takes place on a haunted ship. However, the node for this mission won't show up on your map until you have something called an "<strong>Abyssal Beacon</strong>."&nbsp;</p><p>You can purchase Abyssal Beacon from the game's store. These beacons are keys that give you access to the node for this haunted ship Exterminate mission. Once you have acquired enough Vainthorns, head back to Dagath's Hallow Dojo Room to purchase the blueprints.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have the blueprints, it's time to head back to your ship and select the Foundry to craft Dagath's frame. But hold up a minute! To craft Dagath, you will need to collect a few different components.</p><p>Since Dagath isn't currently available to craft in Warframe, we don't know what those components are. The Abyss of Dagath update arrives on 18 October 2023, and we will update this article with more details on how to get Dagath in Warframe, including more important info, like the time it takes to farm each component.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, we hope this guide gives you an idea of how to get Dagath in Warframe. Don't forget to check back after the update arrives for a more detailed explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/8OOSmvsI81lP06JndyJhIOq8SWdCmFGwtRl4XDI0YhY/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9TaHJleXl5LmpwZw alt="Shreyansh Katsura" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Written by <a href=#>Shreyansh Katsura</a></h3><p>Shrey's obsession with analyzing, introspecting, and discussing every minute detail of video games brought him to game journalism.
