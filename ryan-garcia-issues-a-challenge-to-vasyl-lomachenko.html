Despite this, it seems that ‘KingRy’ might be ready for another challenge in former unified champion Vasyl Lomachenko."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Moreover, Garcia responded to Lomachenko with a fight offer.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Ryan Garcia responds to Vasyl Lomachenko</h2><p>Garcia shared a post of DAZN boxing where it was revealed that Lomachenko has backed Davis. In addition, he claimed that he would be more than willing to take on the amateur prodigy once he is done with ‘Tank’. “So When I’m done with gervonta how about I break this robot,” he wrote.</p><p>The 25-year-old boxer seems confident enough in his skills to beat both Davis and Lomachenko. However, he will have to put his money where his mouth is as Davis will be his toughest test to date. Moreover, Lomachenko is one of if not the best boxers in the lightweight division and possesses a plethora of talent despite being 35 years old.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Canelo Alvarez gives his prediction for Garcia vs Davis</h2><p>Undisputed super middleweight champion <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Canelo Alvarez</a></strong> has also given his prediction for the bout. Despite once being Gacia’s training partner when they were both promoted by <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Oscar De La Hoya</strong></a>, ‘Saul’ has picked Davis to win the bout.</p><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>In an interview with TMZ,</a> he stated that Garcia needed a lot more experience before facing the likes of ‘Tank’. “Garcia is a good fighter. He’s got a lot of talent. But I think he needs more fights before the Gervonta fight,” he said</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210103111626/GettyImages-1294214505.jpg><p>Coming into this fight, Davis will certainly be the favorite to win the bout. However, Garcia is also an undefeated prospect and has the speed and accuracy to knock out any lightweight. On the other hand, Davis is also one of the most powerful punchers in the division, which is why this matchup is so intriguing.</p><p>What did you think about Garcia’s challenge to Lomachenko?
