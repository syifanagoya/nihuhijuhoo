Farrell, 37, briefly dated Narain, 39, in 2003, when she recorded a sex tape featuring the Saving Mr. Banks star. In 2006, the father of two sued after the 14-minute tape was released."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Former bad boy <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Colin Farrell</a></strong> opened up in the March 2014 issue of Elle magazine about his post-rehab sex life and the actor’s infamous sex tape with Playboy model <strong>Nicole Narain</strong>.</p><p>Farrell, 37, briefly dated Narain, 39, in 2003, when she recorded a sex tape featuring the Saving Mr. Banks star. In 2006, the father of two sued after the 14-minute tape was released.</p><p>PHOTOS: Unlikely celeb couples</p><p>“The whole thing was horrifying,” Farrell recalled to Elle. “I was deposed for four hours explaining why I didn’t want it to be released. God forbid, it’s an on-demand movie in a hotel room and my mother says, ‘Oh, I haven’t seen this work of my son’s,’ and hits purchase.”</p><p>But though he tried to conceal some from the graphic details of his romances, the Irish native’s complex love life is no secret. He’s been linked to a slew of stars and models, including <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Britney Spears</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Angelina Jolie</a></strong>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Demi Moore</strong></a>, and even the late <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Elizabeth Taylor</a></strong>.</p><p>In 2003 he welcomed son James Padraig Farrell with American model <strong>Kim Bordenave</strong>, and in 2009 he his second son, Henry Tadeusz Farrell, was born to his Ondine costar <strong>Alicja Bachleda-Curus</strong>.</p><p>These days, the habitual bachelor continues to date, but without several key ingredients — alcohol and drugs. In 2005 the actor went to rehab and has spoken out about his sobriety since. But one factor he hadn’t considered was how sobriety would affect his sex life.</p><p>“I made love to a woman about two and half years after I got clean, and it was one of the most terrifying moments of my life,” he revealed. “It was in the afternoon. The windows and the curtains were open. It was lovely, and to be crass, it wasn’t f**king. She was very gentle. But it was terrifying. &nbsp;Because I was just used to drunkenness and dark rooms and clubs and toilets and wherever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And though his outlook on sex has changed, Farrell isn’t sold on the idea of monogamous relationships.</p><p>“For me, I don’t know if it’s possible,” he admitted. “I’m not saying it’s not possible. I have been monogamous in relationships. But I’m not in a relationship now. So they haven’t worked. So it wouldn’t stand up in court.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp5yeu26ywKupnqScYrCiuMusZKynkpq%2Fbr%2FEsWStnaKntqfFyKeeZqyRobi0edKer2askaWybn6Pamtqa2Jk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
