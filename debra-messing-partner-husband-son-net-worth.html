No doubt, heaven has a new bright light. It's not fair. You're so good. So loving, funny, nurturing, loyal, open, optimistic, and ready to celebrate... anything. Ours was a unique bond. Lori was my ex-partner's ex-wife. Yes, that’s right. And the mother to 2 spectacular girls who I had the opportunity to fall in love with, and who became the sisters my boy never had.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She continued,<strong> “We loved each other’s children and in turn developed a beautiful friendship. We came to every school musical in Princeton, every kidz Theatre production, we went to Broadway musicals together, and she took them to Six Flags. It was special because it was entirely chosen. We sent singing happy birthday videos to each other, and she helped me celebrate my 50th birthday. We were chosen, family. Many, many hearts are shattered right now. Please say a prayer for her family. And remember, we are guaranteed nothing.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Will Chase, the ex-husband of Lori and Debra, also paid his condolences and stated,<strong> “We’re absolutely heartbroken by the passing of our sweet Lori.

It's a very long time. I think the institute of marriage is a noble thing. The idea of a partner for life is incredibly romantic. But now we’re living to 100. A hundred years ago, people were dying at age 37. Till death do us part was a much different deal.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She continued, <strong>“When I say the move to New York was traumatic, it was traumatic, it was traumatic because every aspect of my life was going through a huge change. Every thought is dictated by what’s best for our son. We are completely on the same page in that regard. We are dear friends. And I am at peace with the journey we’ve had. I feel like the 20 years we had together have been a huge success. And despite the fact that everything is changing, I think everyone is thriving. It's a new chapter in my personal life. I'm walking a path I've never walked before. But I'm optimistic.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The former couple continued to co-parent their son very well and said, <strong>“Now we are co-parenting beautifully. We had Thanksgiving together.
