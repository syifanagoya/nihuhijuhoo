The colour codes used to locate utilities, conduit, and rebar in concrete might seem somewhat different depending on the surface on which they are applied. The hues red, yellow, blue, and black are the most often utilised.</p><h3></h3><h3>Second, what is the significance of the pink survey tape?</h3><p>Pink flags — These are used as temporary survey marks and are available in various sizes.
