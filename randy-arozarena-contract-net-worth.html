He became a household name after his breakout performance during the 2020 playoffs, where he recorded a .377 batting average and 10 home runs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Arozarena’s new contract is a significant raise from his previous salary of $716,000, which he earned in the 2022 season. With his new contract, he has become one of the highest-paid players on the Rays team.</p><p>In the 2021 season, he received a salary of $581,200, so the increase to $4.15 million for 2023 is a substantial raise for his career.

None are catching the eye more than Jevon Holland. The 23-year-old Coquitlam-born safety was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 2021 after impressing in two seasons of college football with the Oregon Ducks.</p><p>Holland has not looked back ever since, establishing himself as a regular in the Dolphins team, posting some serious tackle and interception figures.</p><p>In fact, Holland is now the starting free safety position for Miami. So far in 2023, Holland has registered 44 solo tackles, just four shy of the 48 he amassed in his entire debut season in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland and the Dolphins are in great shape for a 2024 Super Bowl bid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-143.png><p>Holland could be celebrating winning his first Lombardi Trophy next year too if the bookmakers’ odds are to be believed. The Dolphins are currently rated as +800 fifth favorites to land the 2024 Super Bowl with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Ontario-licensed sports betting online operator Betano</a>, which has served the Canadian province since receiving its license in October 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland’s first ever NFL touchdown was a big one – in more ways than one!</h2><p>Holland played a key role in the Dolphins’ recent victory over the New York Jets. Holland completed a stunning interception of a hail Mary pass, before returning it with interest for a stunning 99-yard touchdown. It was the first touchdown of Holland’s NFL career and it steered Miami to a comfortable 34-13 victory.</p><p>It’s a win which keeps Miami firmly top of the AFC East. In fact, only the Baltimore Ravens have made a better start to the 2023-24 NFL season in the AFC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The British Columbian safety did more than assist the Dolphins in their quest for victory over the Jets that day. His full-field return triggered an eagerly anticipated giveaway worth over $1 million. During the NFL preseason, electronics firm TCL launched its “Ultimate Gameday Upgrade” committing to give away $1 million worth of 98” televisions if a player managed to score a touchdown from a minimum of 98 yards in.</p><p>Holland beat the minimum by a single yard. TCL also made sure Holland received a 98” TV too, as reward for his feat.</p><p>Holland has missed the last few games for the Dolphins after sustaining a sprain to his medial ligaments in both knees. This disappointing injury was suffered in the same game as his majestic touchdown against the Jets.</p><p>The team continues to use kid gloves with Holland, pushing him only sparingly into team practice. Holland himself admits <a href=# rel=noopener>he’s “taking his time” with his rehab</a> to ensure he returns at the peak of his powers.</p><p>The Dolphins realize just how important Holland has become to their defense, as he also serves as the quarterback of the secondary. Head coach Mike McDaniel described Holland as being “diligent” with his recovery, especially with the chance of a deep postseason run looming.</p><p><strong>Holland’s path to NFL stardom</strong></p><p>Miami is reaping the rewards of recognizing Holland’s undoubted potential in the NFL after making him their second-round pick of the 2021 NFL Draft. Holland had impressed during his scholarship with the Oregon Ducks in the <a href=#>same way as outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux</a>, who was later recruited by the New York Giants.</p><p>Holland’s rookie season saw him display his physical prowess from day one. He exhibited a rare combination of athleticism, football intelligence, and a knack for disrupting opposing offenses. His ability to cover ground in the secondary, make crucial tackles, and create turnovers has earned him rave reviews from Dolphins fans and respect from his peers across the league.</p><p>Beyond his on-field contributions, Holland’s leadership qualities and adaptability have also been noteworthy. Whether patrolling the backfield or contributing on special teams, Holland has quickly established himself as a versatile asset to the Dolphins.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Congrats to the couple!</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Santi-Aldama-Girlfriend.jpg alt="Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Santi Aldama is a Spanish professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association’s (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a>) Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>Before being drafted into the NBA, he was a Loyola Greyhounds basketball player in college.
