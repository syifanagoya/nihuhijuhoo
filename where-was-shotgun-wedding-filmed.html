According to the official synopsis on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a>, “Suddenly everyone’s lives are in danger when the entire party is taken hostage. “’Til Death Do Us Part” takes on a whole new meaning in this adventure as Darcy and Tom must save their loved ones—if they don’t kill each other first.”</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=684 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>The film also boasts a talented supporting cast, including Sônia Braga&nbsp;as Renata, Jennifer Coolidge&nbsp;as Carol, Lenny Kravitz&nbsp;as Sean, Cheech Marin&nbsp;as Robert, and D’Arcy Carden as Harriet. Although it’s based in the Philippines, shooting for Shotgun Wedding actually took place in&nbsp;Boston&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Dominican Republic. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Decider</a>, “Specifically, the movie was filmed at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ANI Private Resorts</a>&nbsp;in Rio San Juan in the Dominican Republic.” Filming was originally scheduled to commence in the summer of 2019, but was delayed until Feb. 22, 2021. Jennifer Lopez later announced via&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;that&nbsp;principal photography&nbsp;had wrapped on April 22, 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shotgun-wedding-jennifer-coolidge.jpg><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>In an interview for the&nbsp;Shotgun Wedding&nbsp;production notes (via Decider), Production designer N.C. Page Buckner said, “ANI provided the level of luxury we were looking for. It had the vibes of a high-end resort, with a bit of an Asian influence built into some of the design.”</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Lenny Kravitz recalled around eight or nine hours a day per week in the ANI Private Resorts swimming pool: “We spent more than a week in the pool, eight or nine hours a day, which took a toll on my clothes and shoes. But we were in this infinity pool at the edge of the resort, looking out to the beautiful ocean, so there was nothing to complain about.”</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>Right now, Shotgun Wedding has a ‘rotten’ score of 44 percent on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, but the audience seems to love it. Although critics weren’t pleased, the audience score sits at a rather satisfying 75 percent.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>Although Shotgun Wedding&nbsp;was released in Singapore in December 2022,&nbsp;it was released on Jan. 27, 2023, by&nbsp;Amazon Studios&nbsp;via&nbsp;Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6uK3SZqqhp6Scwq951p6bnaGenHqntcumnJ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
