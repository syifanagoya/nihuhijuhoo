And by that, we mean that Li isn’t actually dead! We know that Gabi didn’t kill him. At least, we’re pretty sure she didn’t. She may be many things, but a cold blooded killer she is not. And there was just no point. She’s already toyed with, humiliated and taken Li’s DiMera stocks. Why would she then stab him in the back?</p><p>But Li dying just after vowing to make Gabi pay for making a fool of him, messing with his heart and taking his DiMera shares? That was way too convenient. And that’s why we thought that he might have faked the whole thing.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JPI_Episode14719a_0002033794-e1698949276390.jpg alt="A horrified Gabi holds a bloody knife over Li, who lies face first on the floor.

Now, though, Days of Our Lives <a href=# rel=noopener>announced Cherie Jimenez joining</a>, who seems very&nbsp;likely to be playing a recast Gabi. But we wouldn’t get Gabi back unless she was finally getting out of prison. Then there’s Kristen. She just called Li’s dad, Wei Shin, likely in the hopes that he’ll keep EJ out of the CEO chair at DiMera and give it to her.</p><p>Wei hasn’t been back since long before Li died. And if he’s in town, you can bet he’s going to want to get to the bottom of his son’s supposed death. Unless of course, he was one of the people who helped Li fake it. In that case, his return could just kick off the big reveal that Li’s not dead after all. Why do we say that? Well, there’s one very important revelation in the last day that has us more certain than ever that Li would be back.</p><p>Because yesterday, April 11th, Days of Our Lives&nbsp;released a video on their Instagram stories from their big 15,000th episode celebration, packed full of current cast members and those who came back to celebrate. After the big reveal yesterday, April 11th, there were no surprises about who was in attendance. Except one. Because there, in the back, between Galen Gering (Rafe) and Brandon Barash (Stefan) is Remington Hoffman.</p><p>Everyone else on that stage seems to be either crew, writers, producers or current cast. So it would seem that by the time the 15,000th episode airs, Li will be back. Unless Salem’s getting a permanent ghost… But no, they wouldn’t do that. We think.</p><p>Oh, Li, you sly devil. How did you do it? Did you team up with EJ to start a new life somewhere else for a sizable payout so you could both get your revenge on Gabi? Maybe Wei pushed you into it to punish Gabi and hide you away as your own form of punishment for losing your DiMera shares to her. Or maybe, Dr. Rolf’s arm was twisted somehow, to bring you back to life after literally stabbing yourself in the back.</p><p>We aren’t quite sure how (though we’re pretty sure we know why), but one way or another, it’s all but certain Li is alive. He’ll be back. Gabi will be back. And there’s going to be a lot of ticked off folks in Salem.</p><p><strong>Where did Li go? We drew up a <a href=# rel=noopener>list of suspects</a> in the photo gallery below of folks who may have killed him… or helped fake his death!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOp5ywq19sf3Z%2BmG9mq52dnruowM6nZKGnlpu6orqMq5ytraKjeq21jKyfoqZdlrmqwsRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
