His father passed away before his birth, and his mother returned to England, leaving him in the care of relatives.

He was appointed to the prebend of Kilroot in the Diocese of Connor in 1694.</p><p>However, his clerical position in Kilroot did not satisfy him, leading him to return to England and resume his work with Sir William Temple at Moor Park. During this period, Swift also began to develop his skills as a writer and political commentator.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uce0fc0164082327de875373bacf823b9><span class=ctaText>READ: </span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What is Calvin Trillin Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Comedic Style, And More</span></a><h3><span id=Literary-Pursuits-and-Satirical-Works>Literary Pursuits and Satirical Works</span></h3><p>Swift’s literary career took off with works like <strong>A Tale of a Tub</strong> and <strong>The Battle of the Books</strong>.

He became a vocal advocate for Irish causes, which earned him the status of an Irish patriot.</p><p>Despite facing health challenges, including what is now believed to be Ménière’s disease, Swift remained active in the literary and political spheres until his death in 1745.</p><h3><span id=Personal-life>Personal life</span></h3><p>Jonathan Swift, despite his significant relationships and connections, never married.
