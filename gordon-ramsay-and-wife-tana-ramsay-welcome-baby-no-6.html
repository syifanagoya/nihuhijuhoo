“What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!!” the TV chef, 57, wrote via Instagram on Saturday, November 11. “One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls … Done 👊🏼❤️❤️.”
Gordon — whose message seemingly hinted that Jesse was born around the chef’s November 8 birthday — uploaded several photos of Tana, 49, practicing skin-to-skin contact with the newborn."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think there’s one more on the way,” the <i><a href=#>Hell’s Kitchen</a> </i>host quipped during a January appearance on the U.K.’s<a href=# rel=noopener> “Heart Breakfast” </a>radio show.</p><p class=p1>Show hosts <strong>Jamie Theakston</strong> and <strong>Amanda Holden</strong> tried to press for more details about a possible pregnancy, but Gordon played coy. “Do you know what? I don’t know yet. I’ll double-check when I get back,” he joked. “I’m going down to [drugstore] Boots on the way out of here, and I’ll double-check.”</p><p class=p1>Gordon added: “Tana would like another baby and I’m like, ‘No, no, no, no.’ It’s already hard enough thinking about when I go to take Oscar to school, [and people ask], ‘Hey, what’s your grandad’s name?’”</p><p class=p1>Oscar is the couple’s <a href=#>rainbow baby</a>.

You go from having a baby kicking inside of you to <a href=#>suddenly it’s not there</a>, and it was a really hard experience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagp6KZvK950ZqkrJmpYq6vsIywoJ%2BdXamur62Mq5imq5Guerixy5ympp1dl66jxYynpmZuXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
