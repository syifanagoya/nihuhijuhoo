Country star&nbsp;<strong>Jana Kramer</strong> is dating Hollywood's humble&nbsp;<a href=#>hunk</a>&nbsp;<strong>Scott Eastwood</strong>, <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> has exclusively learned. The two were spotted holding hands backstage at Kramer's Oct. 26 concert in San Diego, and then the next night at her show in Anaheim, Calif.</p><p>"They are definitely into each other," a source tells<strong> <a href=#>Us</a></strong>&nbsp;of the couple, who met recently through friends. While 29-tear-old Kramer is focusing on her music career these days, she can relate to Eastwood, 27, given her own success in major TV and film roles. The very photogenic Eastwood was recently photographed with pals at Kramer's concert, as one Instagram user <a href=#>shared</a>. A friend of the actor adds to this, "It's not like Scott to commit so fast, but he's really into her."</p><p>The brunette beauty is best-known for her role as Alex Dupre on the CW's hit series One Tree Hill from 2009-2012. She has also held recurring roles on NBC's Friday Night Lights (as Noelle Davenport), the CW's 90210 (as Portia Ranson) and HBO's Entourage (in which she played UCLA sorority sister Brooke Manning). Kramer's acting career, in part, helped launch her country music ambitions. The "Why Ya Wanna" singer went on tour this summer with headliner&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Blake Shelton</a></strong> and <strong>Dierks Bentley</strong>.</p><p>Eastwood, meanwhile, hit the spotlight in September after a <a href=#>Town & Country</a> style spread of the actor made its rounds. The son of <strong>Clint Eastwood</strong> and <strong>Jacelyn Reeves</strong> (a former flight attendant with whom the Million Dollar Baby director had two children) insisted in the October issue of the magazine how he is <a href=#>relatable</a> far beyond the family name. "People assumed that I would have everything handed to me, but that couldn't be further from the truth," said the San Diego resident and part-owner of a dive bar.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Next up for the hunky star?
