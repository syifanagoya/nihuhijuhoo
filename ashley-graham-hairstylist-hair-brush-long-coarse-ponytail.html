Our hair is one of our favorite forms of self-expression. Whether we’re growing it long, buzzing it off or accessorizing it with clips and headbands, we’re telling a story, and a big part of that story is confidence. That’s why we’re so intent on keeping split ends, frizz and flyaways as far away as possible."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Whether we’re growing it long, buzzing it off or accessorizing it with clips and headbands, we’re telling a story, and a big part of that story is confidence. That’s why we’re so intent on keeping split ends, frizz and flyaways as far away as possible. But the more we waste our time with plastic combs and overly rough brushes, the more issues we’re creating!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mason Pearson Popular Mixture Hair Brush</a> is the key to long, healthy, glistening hair. Developed over 100 years ago, this celeb-favorite, handmade brush has proven its worth over the last century. Even supermodel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ashley Graham</strong></a>’s hairstylist, <strong>Justine Marjan</strong>, uses it on her clients’ hair to transform stubborn strands into luscious locks!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MP-Hair-Brush.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mason Pearson Popular Mixture Hair Brush</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$205</a> at Dermstore! Also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nordstrom</a>!</strong></p><p>Shoppers are referring to this hair brush as “heaven on your scalp,” noting its “salon quality” and “holy grail” status. One said it helped them “grow out [their] short hair to the longest [it] has ever been,” while another called it “so worth it,” confirming that their hair “gets better by the day!”</p><p>Marjan told<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Refinery29</a> just how she likes to use this Mason Pearson brush to tie long, coarse hair into a perfect ponytail. She explained that she “always creates ponytails in sections so that the hair is easier to control.” Once it’s sectioned, she sprays the roots with a strong-hold hairspray and then brushes hair out with this brush while it’s still wet!</p><p>The bristles on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this brush</a> are a combination of nylon tufts and premium-grade boar bristles. Specifically developed to detangle long and coarse hair, these bristles work with the pneumatic cushion, which contours to our scalp as we brush. This may result in a properly exfoliated, massaged, non-irritated scalp, which is key to healthy hair!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brush-and-Cleaning-Brush.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mason Pearson Popular Mixture Hair Brush</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$205</a> at Dermstore! Also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nordstrom</a>!</strong></p><p>This brush claims to separate and smooth out individual strands of hair, minimizing breakage and the formation of split ends. Other brushes make these issues even worse, but this brush may leave us with extremely soft and manageable hair, majorly cutting our styling time down.</p><p>One of the most important qualities of this hair brush is that it’s made to strengthen hair by transferring our natural oils from our scalp down to the ends, protecting the strands from root to tip!</p><p>We think everyone has the basic idea of how to use <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this beloved hair brush</a>, but it’s always more motivating to have a set of instructions. So, before shampooing and just before bed, brush 10 to 15 strokes in each direction! Done! A mini nylon cleaning brush is included with our purchase, so make sure to clean out the bristles every so often!</p><p>Dermstore is including the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminence Organic Skin Care Bamboo Firming Fluid</a> (a $58 value) at no cost with any purchase of $175 or more, so don’t wait! This extra offer is only while supplies last, and with both our hair and skin on point, we’ll feel like we can take over the world.</p><p>Now, please excuse Us, as we need to start sectioning off our hair so we can prepare for the most epic ponytail of all time!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mason Pearson Popular Mixture Hair Brush</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$205</a> at Dermstore!
