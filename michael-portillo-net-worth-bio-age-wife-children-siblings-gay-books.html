This led to the term “Portillo moment” being coined. Returning to the Commons after receiving the Conservative candidacy in Kensington and Chelsea in the 1999 by-election, Portillo joined the front bench as Shadow Chancellor, although his relationship with Conservative Leader William Hague was strained. He finally came in third behind Iain Duncan Smith and Kenneth Clarke, standing for Party leadership in 2001.</p><p>At the 2005 general election, Portillo resigned from the House of Commons and from active politics and has since followed his media interests, hosting and participating in a wide variety of TV and radio programs. Portillo’s enthusiasm for steam trains led him to make Great British Railway Journeys, a BBC documentary show, starting in 2010, in which he explores the British railway networks, referring to different versions of Bradshaw’s Guide. The show’s popularity has led Portillo to present other series on railway systems elsewhere.</p><p>Michael Portillo is a British journalist, broadcaster, and former Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister of the Conservative Party.
