Her husband requested privacy in his hard times.</p><p>Schneider posted on his Facebook profile, <strong>“My beautiful Smile is pain free, living in her new body alongside Jesus. Please respect our privacy during this time of grief. Please do not ask any questions. If you have any pictures of us and our obvious love and adoration for each other, please post them below.
