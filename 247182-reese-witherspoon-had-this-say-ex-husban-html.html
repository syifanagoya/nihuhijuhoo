Their following exchange left the attendees, viewers, and the actress quite surprised and shocked.</p><p class=dh>At the time, Witherspoon was 26, and her husband was 27. As he was about to announce the winner, the actress asked him if she could do it instead and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/reese-witherspoon-flummoxed-ex-ryan-phillippe-s-comment-about-her-t204795>his answer was</a>:</p><p class=dh>"You make more than I do. Go ahead."</p><p class=dh>Speaking to “The HFPA in Conversation” nearly 20 years since the incident, the actress explained how she had felt when Phillippe made the quip. Confessing that she barely remembered the incident, the actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/reese-witherspoon/id1342322983?i=1000503483655">recalled</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I was a little bit flummoxed in the moment."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Witherspoon</a>, who is one of the highest-paid actresses, admitted that she’d forgotten about the incident. She explained that her husband hadn’t told her he was going to say that.</p><p class=dh>The Golden Globe-winning star, who is now 44, confessed that she didn’t know why Phillippe said what he said. A few years later, in 2008, the famous couple sadly ended up divorcing after having two children.</p><p class=dh>The former couple shares a daughter Ava, 21, and a son Deacon, 17. During her recent interview, Witherspoon also noted how hard it was for women who make more money than their partners.</p><p class=dh>She noted how these <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/reese-witherspoon/id1342322983?i=1000503483655">women would get shamed</a> for earning more and are expected to give more. Whereas their male counterparts don’t come across such expectations because there are double standards.</p><p class=dh>The “Cruel Intentions” actress recalled when Ava was 8 and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/29/entertainment/reese-witherspoon-ryan-phillippe-oscars-2002-trnd/index.html>came back upset</a> from elementary school. She confessed to her mother that she was teased because Witherspoon earned a lot of money.</p><p class=dh>The “Legally Blonde” star told her that she should never be ashamed of women making lots of money. Besides her two children, the actress also shares a son Tennessee, 8, with her current husband, Jim Toth.</p><p class=dh>In 2017, she appeared on the British talk show “Lorraine” where she opened up about <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/reese-witherspoon-marriage-ryan-phillippe-i-would-never-change-anything-t116882>her past marriage</a> to Phillippe. She shared how she’d gotten married when she was 23 and had two children by the time she was 27.</p><p class=dh>Despite this, the “Big Little Lies” actress revealed that she wouldn’t change anything about her past. The star advocated for people to get to know themselves so they don’t regret any of their life choices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrcGloZ3qzscSsnGavmam1pr7Sqaaopl2drqV506GgrGWjlsZusddmn66rkpa7b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
