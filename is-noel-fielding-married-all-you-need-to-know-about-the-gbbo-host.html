Presenter: Noel Fielding.<h3>How Old is Noel Fielding?</h3><p>We genuinely couldn’t believe this when we googled how old Noel was.</p><p>He is 45 years old.</p><p>We know, right? We were thinking Noel would have been in his 30’s, but he’s actually only five years away from being 40. Mad. He seems to have that eternal youth kind of look, though, doesn’t he?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17263 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2018/09/GBBO-Technical-challenge-Episode-2.9914-copy-1024x663.jpg alt width=750 height=486 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px">Episode 2, Technical Bake – Noel with Terry baking<h3>Does Noel Fielding Have a Wife?</h3><p>Noel does not have a wife, but he does have a long-term partner of eight years – radio presenter Lliana&nbsp;Bird.</p><p>Lliana&nbsp;currently presents for Radio X but she’s also an actress and a writer – she released her first book in 2016, titled The Mice Who Sing For Sex. Based on that book title alone, we reckon she’s a perfect match for Noel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17273 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.30.14-1024x566.png alt="Screen Shot: Great British Bake Off: Noel Fielding's tomato shirt.

Presenters: Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig.<h3>What Did Noel Do Before Bake-Off?</h3><p>Noel is most famous for The Mighty Boosh, which developed a cult following – much like Noel himself.</p><p>He began, however, as a stand-up comedian in the 90’s. That’s how he met Julian Barratt, the future co-creator of The Mighty Boosh.</p><p>Aside from the Boosh, Noel has appeared in several television shows – with his appearances on Never Mind the Buzzcocks and The Big Fat Quiz of the Year proving the most hilarious.</p><p>Currently, aside from GBBO, he has a voice acting role in the new Netflix show Disenchantment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17268 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2018/09/GBBO-Technical-challenge-Episode-2.9967-copy-757x1024.jpg alt width=750 height=1015 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px">Episode 2, Technical Bake – Noel with Luke baking<h3>Where is Noel Fielding From?</h3><p>Noel is London born and bred.

He attended Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College, which is now known as Buckinghamshire New University. There, he studied a BA in Graphic Design and Advertising.</p><p>Can you imagine Noel in advertising? It’d be some pretty niche advertising, right?</p><p>Weirdly enough, though, the cereal brand Sugar Puffs got into trouble with one of their advertising campaigns in 2008. The campaign ripped off Noel and The Mighty Boosh’s comical a cappella nonsense song, called a ‘crimp’ – which Noel and Julian created.</p><p>There you go. Noel did end up influencing the advertising world, anyway. It was only a matter of time…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center aria-describedby=caption-attachment-17274 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.32.28-1024x567.png alt="Screen Shot: Great British Bake Off: Noel Fielding's tomato shirt.

A few more years with Bake Off and that just may rise like a well-proofed bread.
